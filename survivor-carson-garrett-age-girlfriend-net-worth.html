He wished he could ally with someone who would always support him. However, if it helps him win the game, Garret is personally ready to cooperate with anyone and do anything.</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=#>Why Was Kellen Moore Fired By Cowboy?

He is currently 21 years old; there is no information about his date of birth. However, his hometown is in Rome, Georgia.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His strongest affinity is for Christian Hubicki. Christian embraced his eccentricities and nerdiness to make his opponents want to collaborate with him. Despite being initially regarded as the “weakest” guy in the David tribe, he will use his charisma and brains as a weapon, and after the merge, he becomes one of the biggest threats.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although Carson plans to play similarly to him, his main emphasis will be reducing his danger level until the end.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Garrett does not intend to disclose his engineering background, unlike Christian (especially given the perceptions attached to rocket science).&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Carson-Garrett-Artemis-NASA.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Garrett wants people to only think of me as “Mr. Nice Guy,” and he has a strategy to ensure that nobody notices his incredibly cunning underbelly.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The honor of receiving the National Student Volunteer Award for 2022 from Consult Your Community, a nonprofit consulting group with 26 collegiate chapters, gives him the most incredible sense of pride.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Carson was delighted to learn that so many of his peers had nominated him for the award after he worked his way up to becoming the Georgia Tech chapter president.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Carson Garrett Girlfriend: Does The Engineer Dating Someone?&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It seems like Carson is focused on his studies rather than dating someone. He is an intelligent guy who has worked his way through to become part of NASA at such a young age.&nbsp;</span></p><p>His most significant source of inspiration is his great-grandfather. Carson’s great-grandfather, who grew up in poverty before rising to the position of chief engineer at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, was able to influence NASA projects such as Skylab and Saturn V during a period when space exploration was at its peak.</p><p>Among his interests are 3D printing, Settlers of Catan, photography, Minecraft, strategic board games, space/engineering YouTube videos, and Civilization V Mosquitoes.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=#>Who Is Melissa Hunter From Shotgun Wedding?
