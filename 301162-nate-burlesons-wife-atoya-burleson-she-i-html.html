She later pursued a Master's degree in Education from the same school.</p><p class=dh>Like her husband, Atoya was a college athlete and became a Collegiate Hurdle Track Champion. While taking her Master's, she worked in the NCAA Compliance Department.</p><p class=dh>Since graduating, Atoya has pursued different interests, including the foundation of Atoya Burleson Brand, where she works as the Chief Executive Officer. Besides being an entrepreneur, Atoya is also a podcast host.</p><p class=dh>Because of her experience in the NCAA, Atoya was moved to create the insideLINES podcast to connect with women. The podcast covers several topics, including sexism, racism, motherhood, relationships, and mental health, among others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/8b565d06bbccf219b5e79024be0b1b00.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Atoya Burleson and Nate Burleson during the Rolling Stone Live SF with Talent Resources on February 7, 2016, in San Francisco, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Primarily, it is a platform for women to connect and share their experiences. Atoya launched <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.insidelinespodcast.com/about>insideLINES</a> as a means to empower women and have a safe space for them to open up and discuss life events. In one of her seasons, she focused on women in sports and business.</p><p class=dh>"We are talking to top professionals, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, TV personalities, and influencers," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.njfamily.com/nate-and-atoya-burleson/>said</a>.</p><p class=dh>Atoya is also a blogger and social media influencer with over 14,000 followers on Instagram. Meanwhile, her website focuses on lifestyle blogging, parenting, cooking, traveling, and more. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.atoyaburleson.com/about>wrote</a> on her page:</p><p class=dh>"I created this space as an outlet to share my life and all I've learned throughout my journey. From home ideas (making every house a home), parenting tips [...] this is my life, hopefully making yours just a little bit easier."</p><p class=dh>As a multifaceted woman, Atoya has since appeared on multiple platforms, including People magazine, a Super Bowl Pizza Hut commercial, and the Essence Festival panel.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Nate Burleson and Atoya Were College Sweethearts</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Besides her career, Atoya is a proud mother and family woman. She met her husband, Nate, in college at the University of Nevada. She stayed with him throughout his impressive NFL career, playing for the Minnesota Vikings, Detroit Lions, and Seattle Seahawks.</p><p class=dh>Nate credited his wife for helping him become the successful man he is today. "Without her, I wouldn't have accomplished half of the things that I did," he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.njfamily.com/nate-and-atoya-burleson/>said</a>. "I'm a blessed man so many times over."</p><p class=dh>The couple shares similar interests and advocacies. Like Atoya, Nate is passionate about specific issues, such as social injustice, race, mental health, and relationships. He also uses his voice to influence other generations positively.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/432232b4a90e85815c563e9fef42ff15.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Nate Burleson and Atoya Burleson during The Hollywood Reporter's Most Powerful People In Media at The Pool on May 17, 2022, in New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Nate and Atoya are raising their children with discipline, respect, and fun. One of the ways they empower their kids is through positive reinforcement.</strong></h3><p class=dh>Atoya and her husband are also different in many ways, as she is a morning person, and he is not. Although they don't have similar schedules, they are both committed to raising their family well and doing a great job.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>They Have Three Children, Two Sons, Nate and Nehemiah, and Daughter Mia</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Atoya and Nate are parents to three beautiful children: teenage sons Nate Jr. and Nehemiah, and a pre-teen daughter, Mia. The couple's two eldest kids are also into sports, playing basketball, football, and running track.</p><p class=dh>Nate finds excitement in watching his sons play the same sport he loves. However, he feels conflicted when he sees both of his sons injured because of football. During those times, he thinks twice about encouraging them to be in a sport that can get physical.</p><p class=dh>However, Nate proudly claimed he never pushed his children to do sports. The younger Nate and Nehemiah's love for sports came organically, and their determination improved them.</p><p class=dh>Similarly, the youngest of Nate and Atoya's brood is also into sports and extra-curricular activities. Mia's parents want her to focus on these and academics while she can have the weekends to do as she pleases.</p><p class=dh>Nate and Atoya are raising their children with discipline, respect, and fun. One of the ways they empower their kids is through positive reinforcement. "We also practice self mantras [and] family mantras and find something positive to say to each member of our house every week," Atoya <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.njfamily.com/nate-and-atoya-burleson/>said</a>.</p><p class=dh>Atoya knows she's not a perfect <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://tvovermind.com/atoya-burleson/&nbsp;>parent</a>, but she takes things one day at a time and shows her children love in the ways she knows how. She is a protective mother who will do anything for her children's well-being.</p><p class=dh>Like Nate, several other sports commentators, including <a class="me a" href=#>Al Michaels,</a> have built a family while establishing their careers in the industry. Michaels also met his wife, Linda Stamaton, at a young age and focused on his work during their marriage.</p><p class=dh>Michaels has since covered several sporting events, including the historical "Miracle On Ice" hockey game during the 1980 Winter Olympics. Although his wife's line of work isn't the same, Stamaton has grown fond of sports over the years and took an interest in hockey. The couple is currently living in marital bliss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmxnamlmZ3qvrdOeZJutoqGytLvNrGSwoZaaeqLAzrKYZpqlp7mmv86nZKyglWK2b7TTpqM%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./elvis-granddaughter-riley-keough-news.html>&#171;&nbsp;See How Elvis' Granddaughter Riley Keough Is Following in His Footsteps</a>
