The charges? Conspiracy and inciting to riot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The eight activists who went to trial were: David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, Thomas Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Bobby Seale, Lee Weiner and John Froines.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the court proceedings, all eight defendants took turns making a spectacle out of the event in their own way, using it as an opportunity to protest their causes as well as attacking and mocking presiding judge Julius Hoffman, who had a clear bias towards the prosecution.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With the exception of Bobby Seale — the only Black member of the group — the rest of the defendants shared the same legal counsel. The Chicago 8 would turn into the Chicago 7 after Judge Hoffman ordered Seale to be bound and gagged (after his multiple outbursts) and for his case to be tried separately.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In February 1970, the trial came to a close, with the jury dropping the conspiracy charge but finding five of the defendants guilty of inciting to riot. (Only Weiner and Froines had both charges dropped.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For their disruptive actions in court, Judge Hoffman sentenced all the defendants and their attorneys to prison — between two to four years — for contempt, while the remaining five defendants were slapped with an additional five-year prison sentence and a $5,000 fine. However, the case was appealed and in 1972, both the contempt and criminal convictions against all the defendants were overturned with the exception of Seale, whose criminal sentence was upheld, forcing him to serve four years in prison.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here's a deeper look at the eight defendants — who they were, what they stood for and where their lives took them after making history.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">David Dellinger</h2><img alt="David Dellinger" title="David Dellinger" width=4342 height=2922 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/david-dellinger-1915---2004-speaks-at-a-press-conference-after-being-sentenced-for-contempt-of-court-new-york-new-york-march-21-1969-getty.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">David Dellinger; Photo: Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although David Dellinger came from a wealthy family with a Yale and Oxford education, he walked away from it all to become a pacifist and non-violent social activist.

Over Seale's continuous interruptions, Judge Hoffman ordered his case to be severed and that Seale be bound and gagged. (Henceforth, the Chicago 8 became the Chicago 7.) Seale would ultimately be sentenced to four years in prison.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1970, Seale was tried for being involved in the 1969 murder of a fellow Black Panther who was purportedly an undercover informant.
