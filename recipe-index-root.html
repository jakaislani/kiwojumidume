It‚Äôs also pretty! The vibrant sweet potato contrasts with the pale avocado, and watermelon radish adds a big pop of pink.

In the past, I‚Äôve made zoodles and doodles&nbsp;(noodles made out of daikon radish), but it didn‚Äôt occur to me until recently to make swoodles(?). Is that what we‚Äôre calling them? Anyway, one night, with a hungry stomach and minimal ingredients on hand, I saw&nbsp;this gorgeous recipe for Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, and I realized I could make something similar using sweet potatoes in place of the&nbsp;pasta. This recipe starts with 2 medium sweet potatoes ‚Äì you‚Äôll be surprised how many noodles they make,&nbsp;and then you‚Äôll also be surprised by how much they cook down‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I think there are 2 types of people in this world ‚Äì those who love tuna salad and those who hate it. Because my mom made it all the time when I was growing up, I definitely fall into the first category. But today, I‚Äôm hoping to bridge the ‚Äúhater‚Äù gap with these chickpea salad lettuce wraps. If you‚Äôre not into fishy things, no worries, these wraps are completely vegan.

Or, well, in this case, carrot snacks. These lightly sweetened carrot bites are great for 3pm snacktime or an on-the-go&nbsp;breakfast. They‚Äôre more carroty than cakey ‚Äì and by that I mean that they‚Äôre not cake-like at all and there‚Äôs no baking required (if you‚Äôre really craving cake click here&nbsp;or here). They‚Äôre chewy&nbsp;little balls made from a mix of carrots, sunflower seeds, dates, coconut, and cinnamon.

If you‚Äôve been on Instagram in the last 5 years, chances are you‚Äôve seen these colorful bowls, packed with plant-based goodness like grains, legumes, steamed and raw veggies, and flavorful sauces. According to a 2017 Epicurious article by Katherine Sacks, the name could come from how Buddha collected alms, using a large bowl to gather small bits of food that the residents of whatever village he was staying in could afford to share.

If so, you‚Äôre going to love this version&nbsp;with shiitake mushrooms and kale. If you haven‚Äôt tried it, well&nbsp;now‚Äôs your chance üôÇ The cashew cream has just 5&nbsp;ingredients: cashews, miso paste, garlic, lemon, and black pepper.

If you‚Äôre not already a fan of Laura‚Äôs blog, The First Mess, you should be! This quinoa risotto recipe exemplifies so much of what I love about her work. It appeals to the eyes as well as the appetite, it‚Äôs healthy and accessible, and it combines plant-based ingredients in a really unique way. Traditional risotto is made with arborio rice, and it requires a lengthy amount of time standing over the stove stirring.

I thought I‚Äôd take a second to pop in and share this super simple turmeric latte recipe. I posted it on Instagram earlier this week, but I thought I‚Äôd share it here too.
