href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Chastain</a></strong> sent BookTok, Bookstagram, BookTube, and all other book communities into a collective meltdown when she seemingly confirmed she would not be starring in the Netflix adaptation of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo</strong></a> – a mega-popular novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=603 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>It’s not often that people online all agree on one thing, but Evelyn Hugo had united everyone behind the wish to see Chastain take on the role of the protagonist’s star-crossed lover Celia St. James. Although the Oscar-winning actress once expressed interest in the film by saying <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Send me a script,”</a> a video of her stating she’s “not doing it” has since gone viral. In the aftermath, Chastain has taken to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> to clarify the content of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a>, but it’s looking increasingly likely that another actress will become Netflix’s Celia in the end.</p><p>“I’ve been asked multiple times by fans, to sign books that I’m not attached to contractually. Because it feels wrong, and like I’m taking credit for someone else’s work, I’ll say I cant sign because I’m not doing it. That doesn’t mean I’ve read a bad script,”</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>While the Molly’s Game actress would be an undeniably perfect fit for the role of Celia, there’s no shortage of redheaded, blue-eyed talent in Hollywood that would do an equally great job if they were to be tapped by Netflix. Here are some of our picks.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. Eliza Scanlen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Eliza-Scanlen-2.jpg><p data-characters=680 data-current-count=980 data-injectable=true>We promise we didn’t just include Eliza Scanlen in this list because, like Celia, she played Beth March in a film version of Little Women, but there’s a reason Taylor Jenkins Reid picked Beth for Celia to play out of every character in the book, just like Greta Gerwig chose Scanlen for her film. Both Scanlen and Celia know how to tap in to the more vulnerable, softer sides of their characters, nurturing them with surprising depth and complexity. Playing Celia — particularly the portion of the story related to Little Women, which is absolutely central in her and Evelyn’s relationship — could be a cool full-circle/inception kind of moment for Scanlen.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. Sophie Turner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sophie-Turner-2.jpg><p data-characters=633 data-current-count=933 data-injectable=true>As Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones, Sophie Turner terrifically embodied the dark horse type of character that audiences didn’t take seriously, and often undermined until she proved she knew exactly what she was doing the entire time. Celia shares a lot of those same characteristics. Although pristinely beautiful, innocent, and selfless, the fictional actress was one of the greatest talents of her generation, going on to win three Oscars at different stages of her career, and never letting anyone, not even Evelyn, dictate how she should live her life. We think Sophie Turner would know exactly how to portray this duality.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Olivia Holt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Olivia-Holt-2.jpg><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=897 data-injectable=true>Olivia Holt’s Disney Channel beginnings might have you dismissing our decision to include her in this list but don’t write her off so fast. Not only is Holt currently playing Chicago’s Roxie Hart on Broadway, but she has also more than demonstrated her dramatic talent in shows like Marvel’s Cloak and Dagger and Cruel Summer. A role like Celia’s would be the perfect platform to cement her place among Hollywood’s A list, and Holt definitely fits the bill. From her all-American looks to her kind features, this young starlet would be a great Celia St. James.</p><h2 id=h-6-dianna-agron data-injectable=false>6. Dianna Agron</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Dianna-Agron-3.jpg><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=804 data-injectable=true>If we’re talking classic beauty, it’s no wonder Dianna Agron springs to mind. Although the 36-year-old actress has opted for indie projects ever since being projected into the stratosphere by her performance as Quinn Fabray in Fox’s Glee, she could still find a popular story like Evelyn Hugo worthwhile. We’re sure Agron would look stunning with a red tint in her hair – and there’s no doubt she would be a convincing love interest to whatever actress gets to be Evelyn.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Deborah Ann Woll</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Deborah-Ann-Woll-2.jpg><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>Fans of Marvel’s Netflix shows like Daredevil and Punisher might not know that Deborah Ann Woll is a natural redhead. In Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, Celia is described as the girl-next-door, America’s sweetheart, and effortlessly captivating – a profile that we think fits Woll like a glove. The actress has a calm presence with a hint of spark as Karen Page in the Marvel world, much like Celia herself. It also doesn’t hurt that she’s absolutely gorgeous.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Bridget Regan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridget-Regan-2.jpg><p data-characters=561 data-current-count=861 data-injectable=true>Could Bridget Regan be the older Celia to Sadie Sink’s young adult version of the character? We can definitely see it. This striking natural redhead has made queer audiences swoon for the good part of a decade now with her villainous outings in Agent Carter, Jane the Virgin, and Batwoman, so maybe it’s time she changes things up and opts for the wholesome lover instead? Although we’re used to seeing the snide, vengeful side of Regan, we have no doubt she could bring Celia’s altruistic and compassionate nature to life just as well.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Victoria Pedretti</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Victoria-Pedretti-2.jpg><p data-characters=675 data-current-count=975 data-injectable=true>Victoria Pedretti might not have Celia’s exact look (nothing some blue-tint contact lenses and hair dye can’t fix), but the Haunting of Bly Manor actress has a huge queer following that would certainly love to see her take on a lesbian character as beloved as Celia. In Bly Mannor, Pedretti and co-star Amelia Eve created one of the most beautiful queer couples on TV within the last decade, and it’s definitely important that whoever is cast as Celia can portray real, earnest attraction to another woman. One would think a great actress could play any character, but queer audiences know it’s not always easy to put on a convincing gay performance.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Sadie Sink</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sadie-Sink-2.jpg><p data-characters=778 data-current-count=1078 data-injectable=true>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo adaptation might opt for casting different actresses to play the same characters, seeing as — as the story progresses — the characters also grow older. Sadie Sink is only 21, but when Celia and Evelyn meet on the set of Little Women, the redhead is even younger – between 19 and 20. The Stranger Things actress has proved she is one of the great talents to watch within Hollywood’s new generation, and she is obviously well acquainted with Netflix, considering the streamer gave her the role that launched her career. Additionally, it’s way easier (and less expensive) to age actors up than down. Sink would be a great choice for Celia, truly embodying the ingénue aspect of the character in the early chapters of the book.</p><h2 id=h-1-meghann-fahy data-injectable=false>1. Meghann Fahy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Meghann-Fahy-The-White-Lotus.jpg><p data-characters=720 data-current-count=1020 data-injectable=false>Meghann Fahy is this writer’s personal choice to bring Celia St. James to life. After overlooking the untapped potential of the beautiful Massachusetts native in Freeform’s The Bold Type, the world at large was finally introduced to Fahy’s understated and charismatic acting chops during season two of HBO’s The White Lotus. The 32-year-old actress matches Jenkins Reid’s description of Celia to a T, from the kind blue eyes, to the strawberry blonde locks, and the classic beauty. As an up-and-coming actress, following her success in The White Lotus, taking on a movie as highly anticipated as The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo wouldn’t be a bad move at all for Fahy going forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopaivXam1osCMo5ysq5mYrm6vx5qqrZmZo3qprdJmqpqhlGLAqbHSZqWorF2ZvKq6xmacr52crrtutNSgpmavlWK1osLEZqqopZVitqWxwKxkn6eiYsSpu4ycpq6klGK9ra3YZpqepJmWerTAjKOYpp2jZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-invented-ice-cream.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Invented Ice Cream and How Did It Happen?</a>
